  <p>A waterfall is a natural flowing body of water that drops vertically or nearly vertically from a higher elevation to a lower elevation, <br/>often forming a plunge pool at the base. <br/>Waterfalls are a fascinating geographical feature that can be found in various parts of the world,<br> shaping the surrounding landscape and creating unique ecosystems.</p>
  <i><p>Waterfalls are formed when a stream or river flows over a steep drop in the landscape, often created by tectonic activity, <rb/>erosion, or volcanic activity. The water flows over the edge of the drop,<br/> creating a vertical or near-vertical fall. The height of the waterfall can vary greatly,<br> ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters.</p></i>
